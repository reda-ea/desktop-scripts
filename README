a bunch of scripts I'm using on my ubunut/mint desktop

backup.sh : uses rsync and encfs to do encrypted incremental backup with minimum space usage and easy restoration (just a copy)
gencfs_mount.sh : mounts an encfs folder in a temporary folder and opens it with nautilus
hm_mailsplit.sh : splits an email file with multiple recipients, to multiple file each one sent to a separate email
netdump.sh : listens on a port, dumps network traffic using a command (echo, hexdump, etc), and then forwards it to the actual destination
seekanddestroy.sh : I use this instead of killall to kill interpreted programs (eg python software)
wm_button.sh : unmaximizes/closes the topmost maximized window (the way I'd like unity window controls to behave)
